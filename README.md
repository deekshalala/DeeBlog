DeeBlog

This is a small beginner personal project that I have developed using Android Studio and Firebase.
As a beginner in this field, I have tried to add numerous functionalities to the app.
In this app, you can create a user account, post new blogs, like and comment on other blogs, delete your posts, receive push notifications etc.

I'd be glad to receive suggestions and feedback!
